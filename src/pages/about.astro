          Hi I am Alexandre ðŸ‘‹ I am a Full-Stack developer and graduate in
          Computer Science and Web Development from the IUT of Lannion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I had the chance to work with amazing companies like
          Crisp, Apitic, Getro and Henge and am currently looking for something
          new.
        </p>

        <p>
          Full-time Curious, I am always excited to discover a new industry or
          topic. In my free time, I am djing and managing a DJ collective which
          I cofounded, hosting house and techno parties in the West of France. I
          also read a lot, build side-projects, and spend time with my close
          ones.
