          I use <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> to generate
          the <b>static files</b> for this site. Version control and backups are
          managed through <a
            href="https://github.com/mrcalexandre/alexandremouriec.com/"
            target="_blank">GitHub</a
          >, which also handles deployment via GitHub Pages, supported by <a
            href="https://github.com/mrcalexandre/alexandremouriec.com/actions"
            target="_blank">custom GitHub Actions</a
          > I’ve configured. For styling and layout, I rely on <a
            href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
            target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a
          >, which helps me build various components and pages on this website.
          All my blog posts are written in <b>Markdown</b> to follow the <a
            href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app"
            target="_blank">file over app</a
          > principle. Assets are optimized using <a
            href="https://imageoptim.com/"
            target="_blank">ImagOptim</a
          > for images, and converted in the webbp format by Astro at build time.

          Accessibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          This topic is still a <i>work in progress</i> for me so this website will
          be my playground to improve on accessibility. To make this progress transparent,
          I am currently checking and improving using <a
            href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/alexandremouriec.com"
            target="_blank">WAVE by WebAIM</a
          >.

          Sustainability
        </h2>

        <p>
          I try to make my website as light as I can, with the tools I want to
          use. <b>0.06 g of CO2</b> is produced when someone visits the homepage.
          This is <b>cleaner than 95 % of all web pages globally</b>. This
          website is also running on <b>sustainable energy</b>, by being hosted
          on GitHub servers. Everything can be checked on <a
            href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/alexandremouriec-com/"
            target="_blank">
            Website Carbon</a
          >.
        </p>

          class="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100">
          Privacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>This website doesn't track you and respects your privacy.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no data collection, no ads, no affiliate links, and no
          third-party tracking. You won’t find any pop-ups or intrusive elements
          like modal windows here either. On the privacy aspect, this can be
          verified using <a
            href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight?location=eu&device=desktop&force=false&url=alexandremouriec.com/"
            target="_blank">
            The Markup</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am using <a
            href="https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/"
            target="_blank">Shaarli</a
          > for my curation, where there is also no data collection, no ads, no affiliate
          links, and no third-party tracking. But since I am sharing links to other
          websites, these websites might be doing data collection. I also use <a
            href="https://fulltimecurious.substack.com/"
            target="_blank">Substack</a
          >
          to host my website and this platform uses various third-party trackers.

          Typography
        </h2>

        <p>
          I chose two fonts for this website. Both of them are self-hosted for
          privacy and performance, and are in their variant version. Headers are
          set in <a
            href="http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/index.html/"
            target="_blank">EB Garamond by Georg Duffner</a
          >. Body is set in <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank"
            >Inter by Rasmus Andersson</a
          >.
