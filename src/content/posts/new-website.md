Welcome to my _new personal website_ !

I am Alexandre Mouriec, a French software engineer living in Rennes, France. This website is my personal blog, where I write about my experiences, my projects, and my thoughts on various topics. I consider myself a full-time curious so I will try to write on different topics.

My goal is currently to share my experience as I rethink my tech use, learn new skills.

I am looking forward to be active here and discuss with you.
